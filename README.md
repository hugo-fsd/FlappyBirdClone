# FlappyBirdClone 

[Play the game here](https://hugo-fsd.github.io/FlappyBirdClone/)

This is a simple Flappy Bird Clone I decided to build in order to learn a bit of front-end software development. This was built using html, css and javascript and it's not yet complete.

I started this project after watching [this video on youtube from the freeCodeCamp.org channel.](https://youtu.be/8xPsg6yv7TU?t=3104) It's pretty much my take on this project, giving it a few personal tweaks and changes.
